### Good study books
* [Pro Spring 5: An In-Depth Guide to the Spring Framework and Its Tools](https://www.amazon.com/Pro-Spring-Depth-Guide-Framework-ebook/dp/B076FQ5KFK) - very strong book, even if do don't want to take exam, I would still recommend to take it. You will learn a great deal of spring core stuff.
