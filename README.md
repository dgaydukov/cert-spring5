# Spring5 certification

### Description
Here is my experience for taking [spring5](https://store.education.pivotal.io/confirm-course?courseid=EDU-1202).

### Why do you need it.
There are 2 main reasons to get it.
1. During preparation you will learn a lot of new stuff
2. It may (and may not), help your career

### Contents
* [Spring Tips](https://github.com/dgaydukov/cert-spring5/blob/master/spring5.md)

### TODO
0. xml vs annotation configuraion
1. beanfactorypostprocessor vs beanpostprocessor
2. load context by interface name
3. load AnnotationConfigApplicationContext with java config (annotated with @Configuration) file (with beans)
4. create custom context (load data from .properties files or json context) with PropertiesBeanDefinitionReader and with custom reader
5. how to update prototype inside singleton (proxymode=targetclass)
6. create custom scope (like singleton/prototype)
7. custom beanpostprocessor vs aspect (cause bpp works better than aspect)
